    <h1>Mahendra Singh Dhoni</h1>
    <h2><i>Tribute to Captain Cool</i></h2>

    <p class="p1"> One of the greatest captains of all-time, he remains the only skipper to have won all major ICC trophies - T20 World Cup, ODI World Cup, and Champions Trophy.
        Dhoni led India to their second World Cup title after a long wait of 28 years in 2011.</p>

    <p> MS Dhoni is a hero and an inspiration for thousands of budding cricketers across India but for me he is the inspiration to go forward in life even if you didn't get what you want
        ,even when the life is bowling fast and yorker or bouncer just hold your position and you will get that one ball where you show the World
        that you are not a failiure and can hit a big shot, big enough to make everyone watch.
    </p>
     

    <p>Once MSD said: “My goal is not to be better than anyone else, but to be better then I used to be.”, thats what i applied 
        in my life and start pushing myself day by day to become what I want to be. He also tought me no matter how strong the
        opponent team should be, it can be destroyed by cool and calm mind, because when you are cool in every situation you find
        a way to break through it.
